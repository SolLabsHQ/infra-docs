# 2025-12-12 — SolLabsHQ Foundation

## Summary

SolLabsHQ was established as an independent systems lab to design, document, and implement personal-scale computing architectures with an emphasis on user agency, explicit memory, and drift-controlled AI systems.

This entry marks the formal beginning of the lab’s public architectural record.

---

## Context

Prior work and exploration existed across personal notes and experiments.
This repository consolidates that work into a single, versioned, and auditable source of truth.

The initial focus is:
- SolOS (cognitive architecture)
- SolMobile (native client)
- SolServer (runtime services)

---

## Initial Decisions

- GitHub organization created: **SolLabsHQ**
- Documentation-first approach adopted
- Architecture and decisions to be recorded prior to optimization
- Explicit memory only (no silent persistence)
- Local-first design for ephemeral state

---

## Notes

This is not a product launch.
This is the establishment of architectural intent and authorship.

Future entries will document:
- System boundaries
- Infrastructure choices
- Schema evolution
- Implementation milestones
