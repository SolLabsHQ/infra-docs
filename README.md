# SolLabsHQ — Infrastructure & Architecture Docs

This repository is the canonical architecture and decision record for systems developed under SolLabsHQ.

It exists to:
- Establish authorship and timeline
- Document system architecture before implementation details
- Record intentional design decisions
- Provide a stable reference across repositories

This repo is intentionally documentation-first and code-light.
