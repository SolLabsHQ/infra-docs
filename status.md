# Status

This page is a living snapshot of what is active within SolLabsHQ.

It exists to reduce drift and keep priorities explicit.

---

## Active (Now)

- SolMobile v0: local-first threads, explicit memory UX, cost visibility
- SolServer v0: bounded chat API, explicit memory persistence, usage accounting
- infra-docs: architecture, ADRs, schemas, timeline

---

## Locked Decisions

- Documentation-first architecture (ADR-002)
- Explicit memory model (ADR-003)
- Fly.io hosting strategy (ADR-004)
- Identity and domain mapping (ADR-001)

---

## Not Started (Intentionally)

- Voice-first interaction
- On-device inference
- Cross-device sync
- Automation and actions (email, messaging, calendar writes)
- Attachments and object storage (R2)
- Component-level architecture diagrams (C4 Level 3+)

---

## Revisit Triggers

Revisit scope and architecture if:
- Cost becomes unpredictable
- Drift controls prove insufficient
- Data retention needs change
- A second user or shared mode is introduced
